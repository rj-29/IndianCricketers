# Indian Cricketers

# About
It is just a simple landing page that presents Indian cricket team members in the form of cards. The idea is inspired by shows that broadcast ICC matches.

# Where it can be used ?
It can be used by live score broadcasting websites to show the playing team members. It can also be used by platforms like Dream11, 1XBET, My11Circle, etc., so that their customers can see the faces of the players they are selecting for their teams, rather than just reading their names.

# What are the benefits of using it ?
It provides a better UI for users and is also helpful for people with low vision or those who cannot read. This feature can attract more users.

# Tech Stacks
The entire landing page is created using HTML and CSS only. HTML is used for the textual parts, while CSS is used for colors, backgrounds, hover effects, and cards.
